# Tracy Obeng Project-Portfolio
Welcome! I'm a Master's student in Robotics and Autonomous Systems specializing in Biomedical Engineering. This portfolio showcases selected projects from my academic and personal work.

## Academic Projects 

### 🧠 Neural Decoder for Mouse Tracking using LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Networks.
Built a deep learning model to decode continuous 2D cursor movements from multichannel neural signals, evaluated across multiple LSTM architectures.

### 🧬 Sorting Action Potentials from Neural Data using PCA  
Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to cluster and visualize neural spikes to isolate neuron firing patterns
from raw signal data.
